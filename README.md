# GloVe-NLP

GloVe is an unsupervised learning algorithm used to create word embeddings for use in deep learning models, similar to word2vec.
This is a working GloVe implementation in pure Python and numpy in just ~100 lines of code. Not optimized for use in the real world but could serve as a good learning tool.
